Command Injection Exploitation with Multi-Agent Systems

This project leverages Python and multi-agent systems to identify and exploit command injection vulnerabilities in web pages. The agents collaborate to:

Detect vulnerabilities: Scan and analyze target web pages for potential command injection points.
Exploit vulnerabilities: Execute crafted payloads to demonstrate the impact of command injection attacks.
Automate processes: Showcase how multi-agent systems can work together for efficient vulnerability exploitation.

This project is for educational and ethical purposes only, highlighting the importance of securing web applications against command injection attacks
